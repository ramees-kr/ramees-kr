Hey there! 👋 I'm *Ramees*, a tech enthusiast on the verge of conquering the final frontier of my *IT program* at **Humber College, Toronto**. 

Holding a *Bachelor's in Engineering* from **Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala, India**, 🌍 and an *Information Security certificate* from **Indira Gandhi National Open University, Delhi**, I'm ready to plunge into the dynamic realm of **cybersecurity**.

With nearly three years of hands-on experience providing top-tier technical support to crucial clients at *Infoblox Inc.*—an industry leader in *DNS, DHCP, and IPAM*—I've mastered the art of navigating the complex landscape of *IT challenges*. My journey also took me to *Accenture*, where I wore the hat of an *Application Development Associate*, gaining valuable insights into crafting robust solutions.

As I gear up for my final year starting *September 2024* and eagerly anticipate my graduation in *April 2025*, I'm on the lookout for an exhilarating *co-op or internship position* for the *summer of 2024*. My *GitHub* is a reflection of my passion for learning and innovation, featuring projects that highlight my expertise in *Information Security* and *IT*.

Feel free to explore my digital playground, where I transform ideas into code and tackle real-world problems. Here's to the thrilling journey ahead! 🚀
